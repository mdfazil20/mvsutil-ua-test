SYNOPSIS

	ddiff [-dhiv] [-Q<tmphlq>] [-c<cols>] [-C<num>] [<dataset-pattern1>] [<dataset-pattern2>]

	-c
	    specify column comparison specifiers to pass to SUPERCE.

	-C
	    display <num> lines of context around a displayed line.

	-d
	    Print out debug messages.

	-h

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

	TMPHLQ
	    overrides the current high-level qualifier used for temporary dataset name.

DESCRIPTION

	Compare two datasets to each other. The datasets can be specified using
	standard wildcards and may be sequential, partitioned, or partitioned dataset
	members.

	ddiff supports generation dataset relative name notation when the name is
	fully specified with no wildcard characters.

	The -C and -i options behave in a consistent manner with diff.

EXAMPLES

	Compare 2 text files from columns 1 to 72

		ddiff -c1:72 tstradm.data1.txt tstradm.data2.txt

EXIT VALUES

	0
	    No differences between the files compared.

	1
	    ddiff compared the files and found them to be different.
